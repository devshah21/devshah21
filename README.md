### Hi there 👋

My name is Dev Shah and I'm currently an Undergrad studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Currently, I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at [Dr. Tyrrell's]([https://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca/people/]) lab, researching into leveraging Artificial Intelligence into medical imaging 🔬. My main interests lie in the field of Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning; building models to create a genuine impact on the worlds biggest problems. To keep up with me, I write articles here, & I write personal bi-monthly newsletters here.
