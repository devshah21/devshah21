### Hi there 👋

My name is [Dev Shah](https://devshah.ca) and I'm currently an Undergrad studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Currently, I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at [Dr. Tyrrell's](https://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca/people/) lab, researching into leveraging Artificial Intelligence into medical imaging 🔬. My main interests lie in the field of Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning; building models to create a genuine impact on the worlds biggest problems. When I'm not doing that, you can find me writing articles on AI on [medium](https://medium.com/@devshahs), and putting together bi-monthly [newsletters](https://devshah.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile) for updates on my life.
